**TutorIT**
An academic support platform that connects students for peer-to-peer tutoring.

**About The Project**
TutorIT connects students who need additional learning assistance with fellow students who are qualified to teach specific subjects.

The platform is strictly focused on tutoring services. This means tutors only provide guidance, explanations, and learning support.

Note: Tutors are not allowed to create or complete projects, assignments, or quizzes for students.

**Our Goal**
The main goal of TutorIT is to promote peer-to-peer learning, where students can enhance their understanding of academic subjects through interactive and guided sessions.

The platform ensures that both parties benefit:

Learners: Improve their academic understanding.

Tutors: Gain teaching experience and compensation for their time.
