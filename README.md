TutorIT is an academic support platform that connects students who need additional learning assistance with 
fellow students who are qualified to teach specific subjects. It is strictly focused on tutoring services — meaning 
tutors only provide guidance, explanations, and learning support. They are not allowed to create or complete
projects, assignments, or quizzes for students.

The main goal of TutorIT is to promote peer-to-peer learning, where students can enhance their 
understanding of academic subjects through interactive and guided tutoring sessions. The platform 
ensures that both tutors and learners benefit — learners improve academically, and tutors gain 
teaching experience and compensation for their time.
